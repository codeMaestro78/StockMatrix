### Issue: YFinance Library Not Working Properly

#### Description:

In the `views.py` file inside the `StockSearch` directory, the **YFinance** library is not functioning as expected. The issue might be due to:

1. **Deprecation** - The YFinance library may have changed or been deprecated.
2. **API Limitations** - YFinance could have imposed new rate limits.
3. **Installation Issues** - The library might not be correctly installed or updated.
4. **Data Source Changes** - Yahoo Finance might have changed the structure of its API responses.

#### Possible Solutions:

1. **Update YFinance**:
   ```sh
   pip install --upgrade yfinance
   ```
2. **Check for Errors in the Console**:
   ```python
   import yfinance as yf
   stock = yf.Ticker("AAPL")
   print(stock.history(period="1d"))
   ```
3. **Use Alternative Libraries**:
   - Consider using `Alpha Vantage`, `Polygon.io`, or `Yahooquery` as alternatives.
4. **Check YFinance Documentation**:
   - Visit [YFinance GitHub](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance) for updates and fixes.

#### Next Steps:

- Debug the issue using logs in `views.py`.
- Verify if API calls return correct data.
- Consider migrating to another stock data API if necessary.
